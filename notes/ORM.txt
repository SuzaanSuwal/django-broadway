1. ORM stands for Object Relational Mapping.
2. It is a wway of querying the database without having to write raw SQL queries.
Rather we can directly write python code to query the database.
4. Django has default support for ORM. We do not need to install  extra package for this service.


Let's See basic CRUD ORMs

Read
1. If "ClassRoom" is the name of a model
    => ClassRoom.objects.all() this query is equivalent to "SELECT * FROM CLASSROOM"
    => This gives us queryset


Classrooms = ClassRoom.objects.all()

for Classroom in classrooms:
    print(Classroom.name)

2. Create
# First method
    ClassRoom.objects.create(name="One", address="KTM")
    
    #Second method
    c = ClassRoom(name+"Two", address+"PKR")
    c.save()


#filter

classrooms = Classroom.objects.filter(address="KTM")
classrooms = Classroom.objects.filter(address=KTM", name="Ten")

# get
classroom = ClassRoom.objects.get(name="One")
=> get() method should always be used with unique attributes like username, email, id, phone etc.
=> There are two types of errors associated with get() method
    => MultipleObjectsReturned: It is raised when get() is used  with datad occuring multiple times in a table
    => DoesNotExist: It is raised when get() is used with datda not present in the table
=> While using get() method always keep it inside try...


Note: filter() method doesn't raise above errors.
