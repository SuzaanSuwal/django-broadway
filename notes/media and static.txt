STATIC and MEDIA 
1. In every web app, a developer encounters these terms "media and static"
2. While both of these terms looks similar to assets (photos, videos, css, js etc), there is slight difference between them
3. Static are the fixed assets in an applcation (eg. logo, css, js)
    whereas, media are the user uploads (profile picture, vide files)
